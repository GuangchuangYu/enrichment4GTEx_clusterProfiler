# functional enrichment for GTEx paper

### Guangchuang Yu

------------------------------------------------------------------------

We re-run the comparison with latest version of DAVID (v6.8) and
clusterProfiler (v4) in May 17, 2021. The result can be found in the
[new-result-2021](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/enrichment4GTEx_clusterProfiler/tree/master/new-result-2021)
foulder.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Refer to the [issue](https://github.com/GuangchuangYu/DOSE/issues/6),
this document will reproduce functional analysis using
[DOSE](http://www.bioconductor/packages/DOSE) and
[clusterProfiler](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/clusterProfiler)
packages.

The paper and supplemental files are located at [paper folder](paper).

In page 63 of [supplemental file](paper/Mele.SM.pdf), the authors
mentioned that *genes with high contribution of individuals to splicing
variation* were used in GO enrichment analysis.

The **Individual and Tissue contribution to variation of splicing** was
stored in [supplemental table
17](paper/LargeSupplementTABLES_May1st_2015.xlsx), which was exported as
a [csv file](tableS17.csv).

``` r
table17 <- read.csv("paper/tableS17.csv")

gene <- with(table17, gene_id[ Individuals > quantile(Individuals, 0.98)])
gene %<>% as.character %>% gsub("\\.\\d+", "", .)

``` r
save(gene, file="cache/gene.rda")
```

The authors did not mention how they define ***high contribution***,
here I use the top 2% of genes and get 212 genes with 168 genes that
could be mapped in the DAVID database. Slightly large than the number
(139) reported in [supplemental file](paper/Mele.SM.pdf).

The GO enrichment result reported in [supplemental table
18](paper/LargeSupplementTABLES_May1st_2015.xlsx) is:

I pasted the genes into DAVID and got similar results.

Although the gene list I selected here is slighly different from the one
author selected (which we donâ€™t know), it can reproduce the results
reported in the paper.

Here, I use these genes to perform enrichment analyses and compare
results from DAVID and clusterProfiler.
